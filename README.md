# AutoResolve.AI
**Empowering Rural Business with smart support**

## Inspiration
In modern, businessess are going digital and overwhelmed by customer messages and queries so I built an assistant that gives every seller a helping hand, talks to the customers for them, answer frequent questions, and escalate when get a complex one needs human help.

## What It Does
AutoResolve.AI is an AI_powered customer support assistant that:
- Instantly resolves common customer queries(e.g., "Where's my order?")
- Uses OpenRouter for smart, natural replies
- Detects vague or complex queries and **escalate** to a human
- Modular backend that can **plug into any interface** web, whatsapp,app
